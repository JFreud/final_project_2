Team Name: The Goldbergs

Features/Bugs (as of 6/8/17):

-Visualization works
-Sometimes nodes are pushed too far against edge of screen
-Computation increases after program runs for a longer time, especially with
	     the larger clusters.



Development Log (as of 6/8/17):

6/2/17: Finalized plan together in class

6/3/17: Jerome worked on class skeleton and outlined the classes Node, Network, and the main

6/4/17: Jake examined the class skeleton and noted some problems and concerns

6/5/17: We discussed the skeleton in class

6/5/17: Jake added Edge class into skeleton and reworked class structure

6/6/17: Jake started and Jerome finished a program to create a new file that
	consolidates the data. Jake made a binary search tree to make traversing
	nodes easier. Also finalized the program's structure.

6/7/17: Jake succeeded in getting the information read from the file, but the
	program does not run.

6/8/17: Jerome fixed numerous bugs that were preventing the program from running
	At this point it runs, but computation increases with time.
